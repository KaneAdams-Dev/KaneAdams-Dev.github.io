                Final year group project for Bachelors degree developed under the name Team Tash in 5 months from start
                to finish and presented at the Univeristy of Gloucestershire's showcase, COMX.

                I was the gameplay programmer for the game. My core responsibilities was character controls, core
                gameplay loop, and creating the arena mode.

                    <p>
                        I created the controls for the player to be able to be played with both PC keyboard and a
                        controller simultaniously.

                        <br><br>

                        With movement, stamina is limited resource that charges overtime, making players need to plan
                        oout their next action carefully. Walking and crouching has no cost, but stamina is required to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Running - Small use overtime</li>
                        <li>Jumping - Small use on launch</li>
                        <li>Light attack - medium amount of use</li>
                        <li>Heavy attack - large amount of use</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <img src="/Images/Mobbers/Unchecked/GameScreenshot06-07-24 (00-15-23).png">
                <p>
                    To allow easier traversal around the levels, the jumping has been made advanced with multiple ways to control the jump heights and distance.

                    <br><br>
                    
                    A dynamic jump has been added for the initial launch off the ground where you can hold the jump button and release to impact height of jumps, allowing small hops with a quick press to launching yourself in the air to reach a platform.

                    <br><br>

                    While already in air, the player can perform a second jump and with timing can change how they move, jumping during the ascend can boost height whilst on the fall increases distance.
                </p>

                <img src="/Images/Mobbers/Unchecked/GameScreenshot06-07-24 (00-08-13).png">
                <p>
                    The player is able to strike with both a light attack and a heavy attack at the cost of stamina and cooldown periods. 

                    <br><br>

                    The light attack is quicker to perform, takes less stamina and has a quicker cooldown but at the cost of damage compared to the heavy strikes. Roughly 2 light attacks can be performed during the time for a heavy to recover so timing your strikes and alternating between the who is key.

                    <br><br>

                    Along with attacking, the player can also be attacked that cancels certain actions. Upon losing all health, the player is taken to a game over screen for a visit with the Reaper and the Goddess.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alongside the physical based controls, the player can use mana to perform different tasks.

                    <br><br>

                    For movement, the player can use a dash where they travel in the direction they were facing, allowing the player to get an extra boost to reach a ledge or travel across the map quicker. This dash also allows phasing through enemies, allowing the player to outflank their enemies and avoid attacks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Players are able to cast a fireball, this not only gives the player a ranged attack type but also has some pushback on the player, if used right with enough mana could allow players to traverse long distances without touching the floor, it would just be backwards.

                        Taking inspiration from RPGs, we created character classes with their own strengths and weaknesses that allow for different play styles. I used Object Oriented methods to create a base character and then children classes that alter the different stat variables that make up the character.
    
                        <br><br>
                        
                        With the different classes, designers are able to create a character and change: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Health (maximum, regen rate)</li>
                        <li>Stamina (maximum, regen rate)</li>
                        <li>Mana (maximum, regen rate)</li>
                        <li>Move Speed (walking, crouching, running)</li>
                        <li>Light Attack (strength, cooldown rate)</li>
                        <li>Heavy Attack (strength, cooldown rate)</li>

                        4 classes can be chosen from that have unique playstyles influenced by their stats:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Paladin - Heavy attacker with lots of strength and health, decent amount of magic, and slow speed

                        <li>
                            Arcane Warrior - Small health and low melee damage but can rely on it's high mana for strategy
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rogue - Fast moving, with able to make lots of attacks with high stamina to balance out the lack of strength and magic
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Peasant - The hard difficulty, playing with little health, strength, magic, and speed
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    The player can level improve these stats by leveling up. Along with the stats for the character, level and experience variables are also included.
                </p>

                    Each enemy contains a certain amount of XP that upon defeating the enemy is gifted to the player. Once the player reaches the maximum XP for that level, the player is leveled up.
                    
                    <br><br>

                    Upon leveling up, the XP bar is reset to 0 + any remaining XP from the kill, so if they gained 105XP and only needed 100, the 5 is added to the next level. Leveling up increases amount of XP required, having the player defeat more enemies or more challenging ones.
                </p>

                    Leveling up rewards the player by increasing their character stats, allowing them to hit and get hit harder, move quicker and for longer, and use more spells.

                    <br><br>

                    Along with stat increases, their health, stamina, and mana bars are refilled to full for the new limit.

                <p>
                    Branching dialogue was added to the game using the inkle API for Unity, this allowed easy to follow dialogue and where different paths in the conversation can lead to, making it easy for anyone on the team to be able to contribute to characters' speech.

                    <br><br>

                    Writing dialogue was done within the Inky IDE using their markup language Ink, and was then converted to JSON within Unity to be used within the game. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Along with implementing inkle, I created the system used to add the dialogue from the text files into the game with dialogue boxes that appear after interacting with an NPC. 
                    
                    <br><br>

                    When a character starts speaking, the words apear 1 letter at a time, acting as both an eye-catching visual and to give a minimum amount of time for people to read before the buttons to continue dialogue or make a decision appears.

                        Using CSS within the inky editor, I added customisation to parts of text during dialogue. This allowed key parts of text to be outlined clearly to draw a player's attention, such as controls, whilst other times add personality to how a character speaks. Using CSS I: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="color: aqua;">Changed font colours</li>
                        <li>Emphasised with <b>Bold</b> and <i>Italics</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                

                <img src="/Images/Mobbers/Unchecked/GameScreenshot06-07-24 (11-45-05).png">
                <p>
                    I set variables up within inkle that are then assigned within Unity to allow the dialogue to impact what is happening in the game. 

                    <br><br>

                    At the start of the game, all controls apart from interacting are locked and as you progress through the tutorial, talking to the NPC Rambleon will unlock the controls required for each section of the tutorial along with the required stat bars (stamina, mana, health). 
                    
                    <br><br>

                    In arena mode, talking to Rambleon between rounds will have the player say whether they are ready for the next round, saying no closes ends the conversation and yes starts the next round countdown.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Along with creating the dialogue systems, I contributed to the creation of the dialogue during the tutorial between the player and the character Rambleon. 

                    <br><br>

                    For the character, the dialogue is chosen to be of someone confused as to what is happening around them, enforcing the need for a tutorial to explain to people.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Rambleon guides the player by giving tips on what to do next and what keys to press whilst making jokes and having the characteristics of a crazy old man.
