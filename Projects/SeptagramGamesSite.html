                        <p>
                            I created the controls for the player to be able to be played with both PC keyboard and a
                            controller simultaniously.

                            <br><br>

                            With movement, stamina is limited resource that charges overtime, making players need to
                            plan
                            oout their next action carefully. Walking and crouching has no cost, but stamina is required
                            to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Running - Small use overtime</li>
                            <li>Jumping - Small use on launch</li>
                            <li>Light attack - medium amount of use</li>
                            <li>Heavy attack - large amount of use</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <img src="/Images/Mobbers/Unchecked/GameScreenshot06-07-24 (00-15-23).png">
                    <p>
                        To allow easier traversal around the levels, the jumping has been made advanced with multiple
                        ways to control the jump heights and distance.

                        <br><br>

                        A dynamic jump has been added for the initial launch off the ground where you can hold the jump
                        button and release to impact height of jumps, allowing small hops with a quick press to
                        launching yourself in the air to reach a platform.

                        <br><br>

                        While already in air, the player can perform a second jump and with timing can change how they
                        move, jumping during the ascend can boost height whilst on the fall increases distance.
                    </p>

                    <img src="/Images/Mobbers/Unchecked/GameScreenshot06-07-24 (00-08-13).png">
                    <p>
                        The player is able to strike with both a light attack and a heavy attack at the cost of stamina
                        and cooldown periods.

                        <br><br>

                        The light attack is quicker to perform, takes less stamina and has a quicker cooldown but at the
                        cost of damage compared to the heavy strikes. Roughly 2 light attacks can be performed during
                        the time for a heavy to recover so timing your strikes and alternating between the who is key.

                        <br><br>

                        Along with attacking, the player can also be attacked that cancels certain actions. Upon losing
                        all health, the player is taken to a game over screen for a visit with the Reaper and the
                        Goddess.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Alongside the physical based controls, the player can use mana to perform different tasks.

                        <br><br>

                        For movement, the player can use a dash where they travel in the direction they were facing,
                        allowing the player to get an extra boost to reach a ledge or travel across the map quicker.
                        This dash also allows phasing through enemies, allowing the player to outflank their enemies and
                        avoid attacks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Players are able to cast a fireball, this not only gives the player a ranged attack type but
                        also has some pushback on the player, if used right with enough mana could allow players to
                        traverse long distances without touching the floor, it would just be backwards.

                            Taking inspiration from RPGs, we created character classes with their own strengths and
                            weaknesses that allow for different play styles. I used Object Oriented methods to create a
                            base character and then children classes that alter the different stat variables that make
                            up the character.

                            <br><br>

                            With the different classes, designers are able to create a character and change:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Health (maximum, regen rate)</li>
                            <li>Stamina (maximum, regen rate)</li>
                            <li>Mana (maximum, regen rate)</li>
                            <li>Move Speed (walking, crouching, running)</li>
                            <li>Light Attack (strength, cooldown rate)</li>
                            <li>Heavy Attack (strength, cooldown rate)</li>
                        </ul>

                            4 classes can be chosen from that have unique playstyles influenced by their stats:

                            </li>

                                Arcane Warrior - Small health and low melee damage but can rely on it's high mana for

                        Each enemy contains a certain amount of XP that upon defeating the enemy is gifted to the
                        player. Once the player reaches the maximum XP for that level, the player is leveled up.

                        <br><br>

                        Upon leveling up, the XP bar is reset to 0 + any remaining XP from the kill, so if they gained
                        105XP and only needed 100, the 5 is added to the next level. Leveling up increases amount of XP
                        required, having the player defeat more enemies or more challenging ones.

                    <p>
                        Leveling up rewards the player by increasing their character stats, allowing them to hit and get
                        hit harder, move quicker and for longer, and use more spells.

                        <br><br>

                        Along with stat increases, their health, stamina, and mana bars are refilled to full for the new

                        Branching dialogue was added to the game using the inkle API for Unity, this allowed easy to
                        follow dialogue and where different paths in the conversation can lead to, making it easy for
                        anyone on the team to be able to contribute to characters' speech.

                        <br><br>

                        Writing dialogue was done within the Inky IDE using their markup language Ink, and was then
                        converted to JSON within Unity to be used within the game.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Along with implementing inkle, I created the system used to add the dialogue from the text files
                        into the game with dialogue boxes that appear after interacting with an NPC.

                        <br><br>

                        When a character starts speaking, the words apear 1 letter at a time, acting as both an
                        eye-catching visual and to give a minimum amount of time for people to read before the buttons
                        to continue dialogue or make a decision appears.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            Using CSS within the inky editor, I added customisation to parts of text during dialogue.
                            This allowed key parts of text to be outlined clearly to draw a player's attention, such as
                            controls, whilst other times add personality to how a character speaks. Using CSS I:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="color: aqua;">Changed font colours</li>
                            <li>Emphasised with <b>Bold</b> and <i>Italics</i></li>

                    <p>
                        I set variables up within inkle that are then assigned within Unity to allow the dialogue to
                        impact what is happening in the game.

                        <br><br>

                        At the start of the game, all controls apart from interacting are locked and as you progress
                        through the tutorial, talking to the NPC Rambleon will unlock the controls required for each
                        section of the tutorial along with the required stat bars (stamina, mana, health).

                        <br><br>

                        In arena mode, talking to Rambleon between rounds will have the player say whether they are
                        ready for the next round, saying no closes ends the conversation and yes starts the next round
                        countdown.
                    </p>

                    <img src="/Images/Mobbers/Unchecked/GameScreenshot06-07-24 (00-01-05).png">
                    <p>
                        Along with creating the dialogue systems, I contributed to the creation of the dialogue during
                        the tutorial between the player and the character Rambleon.

                        <br><br>

                        For the character, the dialogue is chosen to be of someone confused as to what is happening
                        around them, enforcing the need for a tutorial to explain to people.

                        <br><br>

                        Rambleon guides the player by giving tips on what to do next and what keys to press whilst
                        making jokes and having the characteristics of a crazy old man.

                        Along with the tutorial level, an arena mode was also created where the player can fight endless
                        amount of enenmies until they eventually lose.
                    </p>

                        When starting arena mode the player will spawn in the arena used within the boss fight against
                        Bernard where there would be Rambleon standing in the centre.

                        <br><br>

                        The gamemode is split into multiple waves where the player has to talk to Rambleon and confirm
                        whether they are ready for the next round, where a countdown timer will start before enemies are
                        spawned in. Having to talk to Rambleon offers the player breathing time between waves and allow
                        any stats to auto regen to give the player the best chance.

                    <p>
                        There are 10 unique waves within the mode where different enemies are spawned in each round,
                        allowing the player to get used to the arena mode loop. On round 1, a single enemy spawns at one
                        of the spawn points within the arena and more enemies are added until round 10 with multiple
                        enemies.

                        <br><br>

                        When the player reaches round 10, the loop starts over again with the stats increased for the
                        enemies to give the player a challenge. Both gaining health increases with Fire Elementals
                        becoming faster while Earth Elementals throw rocks harder.

                            screensize and be interacted with by the player. The core UI includes:

                            <li>Stats bars</li>

                        In the game there are 4 stats bars shown on screen, these being the health, stamina, mana, and
                        level. As these health bars change, they have an animation that plays to show the change
                        gradually, with the difference between the old and new values being a yellow bar that
                        interpolates between the values.

                        <br><br>

                        As the player increases their level, the other stat bars increase in size to give visual
                        indications that they have more of a particular stat. Having the stat bars able to change size
                        also provides a good indication to that a class is particularly good for.

                        For the dialogue, a button prompt will appear above the character that wants to talk to you.
                        Pressing the prompt will reveal a box from below the camera that will show the characters' name
                        and reveals their text 1 letter at a time, providing time to read it fully. Once the dialogue is
                        completed a continue button will appear to show the player's response or end the dialogue
                        entirely.

                        <br><br>

                        In cases with decisions to make 2 dialogue boxes appear with the options that player can choose
                        from. Upon finishing the conversation, all text is removed from the box and the box will descend
