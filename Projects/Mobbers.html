                Mobbers is a roguelike dungeon shooter with randomised items, rooms, and enemies. Choose to play as the
                Goblin, Skeleton, Slime or Kobold and turn against the other mobs in the dungeon to escape the ever
                approaching heroes trying to loot your home.

                        A level consists of multiple rooms that the players can tranverse between.

                        <br><br>

                        For the placement of rooms I use a grid and from the central point place a start room that only
                        has a north entrance. From this initial room, potential rooms are branched off and checks
                        whether there is already a room there. This continues more branches are created either a desired
                        number of rooms or created or there has been enough attempts to place a room.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once a layout is chosen, neigbouring rooms would be counted and the room would be assigned its
                        room oriantation with doors representing a direction on a compass (NESW).

                        <br><br>

                        With the room oriantations, rooms can be selected from a folder labelled with the appropriate
                        directions, with these rooms being stored as 64x64 files team members can make with colours
                        representing what type of object is placed, such as black and greys used for walls and corners,
                        blues used for flooring, and red for traps.
                    </p>

                        When generating a room, the generator stores all the pixels and checks each one to a
                        corresponding colour in a dictionary and spawns a prefab of that type, if it is an obstacle then
                        a random one is chosen.

                        <br><br>

                        Once the prefab is spawned, the generator checks neighbouring objects and rotates appropriately.

                            Textures are chosen based on the pretermined theme. All available textures for a theme are
                            stored on texture atlases which is zoomed in and uses random offsets to create unique
                            looking room sections without require lots of textures.

                            Themes available are:

                            Along with folders for different room oriantations, special rooms can be placed which allow

                        Once the layout of the dungeon and rooms are chosen, the dungeon manager controls when rooms are created and players are moved between rooms.

                        <br><br>

                        When players are spawned into a room, the neigbouring rooms are generated with the presets
                        already chosen, reducing wait time from generating up to 50 rooms when starting to only
                        generating a maximum of 3 during transition fades. Rooms the player aren't currently in are set
                        inactive.

                        To help prevent the player from getting lost in the dungeon, a minimap is available that reveals
                        explored rooms. This map uses the template provided for the room generation and only applies
                        colours for the floors and walls.

                        Along with randomly room generation, a seed generator is available in editor to allow control of
                        what is generated, allowing ease of testing for bugs by saving the seed and creating specific
                        levels for marketing and playtests.

                        Users can use both numbers and words which converts to hashcodes for seed assigning.

                    Once a room is cleared, the doors are opened and a friendly mimic chest will spawn. After interacting with the mimi, the timer pauses offering a breather to the players to collect any drops and explore further. Once the players enter a new room, including rooms previously explored, the timer starts again until times up or the next chest.
