                        A level consists of multiple rooms that the players can tranverse between.

                        <br><br>

                        For the placement of rooms I use a grid and from the central point place a start room that only
                        has a north entrance. From this initial room, potential rooms are branched off and checks
                        whether there is already a room there. This continues more branches are created either a desired
                        number of rooms or created or there has been enough attempts to place a room.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once a layout is chosen, neigbouring rooms would be counted and the room would be assigned its
                        room oriantation with doors representing a direction on a compass (NESW).

                        <br><br>

                        With the room oriantations, rooms can be selected from a folder labelled with the appropriate
                        directions, with these rooms being stored as 64x64 files team members can make with colours
                        representing what type of object is placed, such as black and greys used for walls and corners,
                        blues used for flooring, and red for traps.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When generating a room, the generator stores all the pixels and checks each one to a
                        corresponding colour in a dictionary and spawns a prefab of that type, if it is an obstacle then
                        a random one is chosen.

                        <br><br>

                        Once the prefab is spawned, the generator checks neighbouring objects and rotates appropriately.

                            Textures are chosen based on the pretermined theme. All available textures for a theme are
                            stored on texture atlases which is zoomed in and uses random offsets to create unique
                            looking room sections without require lots of textures.

                            Themes available are:

                            Along with folders for different room oriantations, special rooms can be placed which allow

                        Once the layout of the dungeon and rooms are chosen, the dungeon manager controls when rooms are
                        created and players are moved between rooms.

                        <br><br>

                        When players are spawned into a room, the neigbouring rooms are generated with the presets
                        already chosen, reducing wait time from generating up to 50 rooms when starting to only
                        generating a maximum of 3 during transition fades. Rooms the player aren't currently in are set
                        inactive.

                        To help prevent the player from getting lost in the dungeon, a minimap is available that reveals
                        explored rooms. This map uses the template provided for the room generation and only applies
                        colours for the floors and walls.

                        Along with randomly room generation, a seed generator is available in editor to allow control of
                        what is generated, allowing ease of testing for bugs by saving the seed and creating specific
                        levels for marketing and playtests.

                        Users can use both numbers and words which converts to hashcodes for seed assigning.

                        As lead programmer, I took on roles of helping the rest of the programming team by providing
                        help
                        with researching, debugging, planning ideas and preparing assets for functionality to be added.
                        This is mainly the case for the item system.

                        <br><br>

                        For the work on the item system, I would use the tool provided to create the prefabs for item
                        and
                        weapon pickups, with animated items having to slice the spritesheets.

                    <p>
                        Outside of helping on the item system, I worked on adding the item system to the game by
                        allowing
                        weapons to merge. Before the character gets the new weapon, if they are already got a weapon
                        equipped then it will check whether the new one is in a dictionary of mergables as a key and
                        would
                        instead equip the weapon under that key's value.
                    </p>

                    <img src="/Images/Mobbers/Unchecked/GameScreenshot06-07-24 (11-55-41).png">
                    <p>
                        I created small health pickups and coins that the player can use to get back some lost health or
                        spend with the shop respectively. These items are dropped by enemies and from breaking certain
                        props
                        within the environment.

                        <br><br>

                        To prevent a single player hogging all the coins and health, colour coding has been added to
                        these
                        drops to indicate only a specific can pick up these items.

                    <img src="/Images/Mobbers/Unchecked/GameScreenshot06-07-24 (11-45-05).png">
                    <p>
                        When sent to the shop room, coins earned from the dungeon can be spent on shop pillars. The
                        player
                        gets close to the pillar and if they have enough coins, a UI prompt will appear to interact and
                        buy
                        an item. Once the item is bought, the shop will take a couple of seconds before spawning a new
                        item
                        on the pillar to buy.

                        <br><br>

                        The pillars are colour coded to fit different tiers and allows a random item of that tier to be
                        spawned on the pillar. These stores are will have different prices as the tiers get better,
                        encouraging players to collect more coins from the dungeon rounds.

                    <img src="/Images/Mobbers/Unchecked/GameScreenshot06-07-24 (00-01-05).png">
                    <p>
                        Items are initially only found within the mimic chest where after the player picks them up they
                        will
                        unlock within the shop room.

                        <br><br>

                        These items are saved within a binary data file, adding some security to prevent players from
                        altering the file and giving themselves game ending weapons.

                        Along with creating the dungeon, I worked alongside the AI prgrammer on having the enemies spawn
                        within the rooms by checking a random spot in a room and checking with there is room to move
                        around
                        and not immedietely attack the player upon entering.

                        Enemy difficulty is able to be impacted by outside factors to provide a balance between player
                        enjoyment and challange.

                        <br><br>

                        The number of enemies are impacted by both the room size and the number of players. The number
                        of
                        enemies will by between set boundaries based on the number of floor tiles there are, so in small
                        rooms with less than 200 tiles, 1-3 enemies can spawn for a single player and 9-17 spawn in
                        rooms
                        with 2000+ tiles. After getting the range, the number of enemies can be increased by amount of
                        players divided by 2, so with 1 player then no extras, 1 extra with 2-3 players and 2 with all 4
                        players.

                            Traps provide the most challange for the players as they are the most varied, able to
                            take aspects of all the other obstacle types with the added element of activing trying
                            to stop the players.

                            <br><br>

                            Traps will attempt to stop the players by:

                            <li>Push the players into enemies or other traps</li>
                            <li>Causing damage over time</li>
                            <li>Instantly killing the players</li>

                        Like some props, some traps can be broken to prevent future problems for the players. These
                        would only have 2 stages (fixed and broken) and would give any coins for health, being alive is
                        your reward.

                        This includes 10 variations of cobwebs that slow down the player while they are in a fixed web.

                            Some traps require being activated by a trigger from a player or enemy being too close to
                            them. These traps will play an animation upon activation and will then have a short timer
                            before the trap can be triggered again. To help visually, all trigger traps are activated
                            upon entering a room. Triggered traps include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Spike traps that will pierce the players upon being stood on</li>

                            Alongside the traps found on floors, wall traps are also available. While these do not take
                            up space on the floor, hiding in a corner will not help the players as these wall traps can
                            are triggered when the player gets close to them. These traps include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Air vents that push players into traps</li>

                        Unlike 1 unit big traps and wall traps that are limit to a set square, pits are able to be
                        created at a range of sizes. In similar style to flooring and walls, designers say where the pit
                        edge and all is and the rest is filled in will an abyss that immedietely kills the player when
                        they fall in.

                        <br><br>

                        To make pits easier to evade, a slow down effect is added on the edges to indicate to players
                        that it is dangerous along with allowing players to dodge over pits, allowing the option to
                        place pits to cover doors and requiring the player to dodge over them.

                        Along creating dungeon generation and gameplay functionality, I was involved in creating the
                        lighting for the game. As the dungeon is procedural, all the lighting is created in runtime. I
                        worked on the lighting for the environments, obstacles, and characters in the game.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For environment and ambient lighting, I applied the lighting to the props within the room.
                        Specific
                        objects that have their own colour can be spawned to allow the designers to choose a minimum
                        amount
                        of lighting within the room. This includes torches on pillars, bonfires, and candlesticks. Some
                        traps are also able to provide lighting, such as a red flow from the heating vents, which can
                        help
                        bring the players' attention to the trap.

                        <br><br>

                        Lighting from flames are able to be animated with a flickering effect to add some realism to the
                        visuals.

                            Lighting on characters act like a spotlights and follow them around, colours are used to
                            give
                            hints on what is being shown, for non players these are:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Red for enemies to mean danger</li>
                            <li>Yellow/Gold for chest to mean treasure</li>
                            <li>The main colour of the boss (so purple for Afner, orange for Keebo)</li>

                        <p>
                            Spotlights on characters are made reactive to show when a character has taken damage or has
                            been
                            defeated by flashing off or fading respectively.

                            Player spotlights work similar to the enemies where they are reactive. However instead of a
                            single
                            colour being used for all players, different colours have been used to help with character
                            differentiation.

                            When playing alone the spotlight for the player is white with no need to differentiate, but
                            as
                            soon
                            as more characters then each player are assigned colours in the following order:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Yellow</li>

                        <p>On PS5 controllers, the LEDs are able to change colour to match the spotlight, an added

                    <p>
                        To help with game production, I provided assistance with animation implementation into Unity.
                        When
                        art is completed and ready to be added to the game, I would be given the spritesheets and edited
                        them by changing compression style, pixel Unit value, and slicing them.

                        <br><br>

                        Once sliced I keyframed the and set up the animations with the framerate and created the basic
                        prefabs, ready for the appropriate programmer to provide functionality.
                    </p>

                    <img src="/Images/Mobbers/Unchecked/GameScreenshot06-07-24 (23-37-58).png">
                    <p>
                        When setting up the animations, I created eventhandler scripts and added events within the
                        animation
                        timeline, allowing frame based functionality such as spawning objects thrown, or unlocking boss
                        room
                        doors.

                        <br><br>

                        Collisions and light intensities would also be impacted by the animations, from having the
                        airvent
                        traps increase their collider as the wind animation becomes larger, or making of a fireball
                        brighter and lighter
                        as a baby dragon prepares a shot.

                            Along with preparing animations for others, I added functionality to my animations related
                            to the dungeon, where I would add:

                            <li>Transition fades between rooms</li>
                            <li>Animations for traps, such as wall vents</li>
                            <li>UI animations that play even when the timescale is 0 and the game is frozen</li>
                            <li>Title screens for entering a miniboss/boss room</li>
                            <li>Looped loading animation when starting a game</li>
                            <li>Spawning, Opening and Exitting of the Mimic chest</li>
                            <li>Flickering of candlelights, where the animation can start at any frame to prevent
                                synchronised animations</li>

                            I worked on the system where at any point the camera can shake, adding more weight on
                            animations that happen on screen. This system was created to allow the team to call the
                            function and control how long the animation plays and at what intensity.

                        Alongside creating functionality for the audio in the game, I did the voice acting for the boss
                        Afner the Barbarian. Afner's voice lines entail mostly of shouts and yells of anger to fit the
                        style of Barbarian rage. I recorded multiple takes and chose the best ones before adding them
                        ingame.

                        As Lead Programmer, I was involved wih the planning of the game from the programmers'
                        standpoint, communicating with both the design and programming team on what is possible wihtin
                        the timelimits we had to get features working in and the assigning appropriate tasks to the
                        programmers.

                    <p>
                        For planning workflow and task assignment, we used HackNPlan with tensorboards to plan out the
                        work for our sprints. As one of the admins on HackNPlan, I was able to see add, edit and assign
                        tasks to team members in accordance to frequent team meetings.

                        <br><br>

                        The project was stored on GitHub where I managed the repository, reviewed commits, and fixed
                        conflicts along multiple branches.

                        Leading the programming team required wearing many hats where I was involved with multiple
                        components of the game. Alongside my own contributions I was also responsible for reviewing the
                        work provided by the team, checking it fits the requirements previously set up and compatability
                        with the rest of the project through vigarous QA testing.

                        <br><br>

                        I also provided assistance with workloads through providing research to help develop features,
                        completing smaller tasks such as setting up prefabs, debugging and optimising work.

                        My role of lead programmer stretched outside of the programming team; communicating between the
                        design and programming teams to find a balance between the features that the designers want and
                        not overloading the programmers.

                        <br><br>

                        I tested feasibility by breaking down the request down into its core elements to find what is
                        required and create rapid prototypes for the concept with a single element before confirming an
                        idea and assigning it for production.

                        I was involved with the hiring of contractors provided as part of the university requirements,
                        having hired 2 artists and 1 programmer that was worked closely with to help the workload for
                        the AI programmer from setting up prefabs to even creating their own enemy AI.

                        Also led the work experience for a school student where they took on the role of QA tester,
                        playtesting and providing tickets of bugs found and how to replicate them whilst I looked into
                        the tickets and provided pug fixes.

                        As programming lead, I was given the responsibilities and privalage to release the demo for
                        Mobbers on Steam, creating builds of the game with final testing of any major issues before
                        releasing publically for people to play.

                        <br><br>

                        The demo is limited to one theme with one boss to fight, providing a complete gameloop of 5
                        minutes where after defeating the boss and leaving returns the players to the main menu. Losing
                        will restart the dungeon with a brand new game seed to play.

                        With the game currently in development, I am tasked with creating updates to the demo where I
                        implement patches for bugs found and new features that benefit the demo whilst not giving away
                        too much of the game.

                        <br><br>

                        I also organise the Steam events that we are invited to, namely Steam Next Fest and Remote Play
                        Together. I planned what updates can come out to help push the relevance of the game along with
                        monitored background data.

                        <br><br>

                        With updates and event participation, the game received 400 wishlists within the first 6 months
                        of the demo being released.

                        Outside of game development, I worked alongside the team on the marketing for the game that
                        helped it reach its wishlist count.

                        <br><br>

                        I initially helped with the creation of promotional material by thinking up post ideas for
                        social media, specifically X, both planning the wording for the post and recording game footage
                        for GIFs, Screenshots with a screenshot script I created, and videos for trailers. As of
                        recently, I am the primary marketer for the game, planning out when to write posts and what to
                        talk about, controlling socials on X, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.

                        Mobbers took part in multiple events online to further the game's reach, taking part in the Game

                            Alongside digital marketing, we have also participated in both private and public
                            exhibitions, invents we've been to include:

                            When taking part of these events, I helped with setting up and taking down the stands,
                            interacting with guests where we advertised the game and played the demo. We also provided
                            quick ongoing builds between days with bug fixes to help improve the game and providing a
                            better experience, even as far as contributing to the completion of our second boss on the
                            evening of our first Insomnia event, providing a whole new experience on the second day.

                        As results of taking part in these events, we were able to attract more people to our game and
                        social accounts and gain a boost in Wishlists, helping us reach 400.

                        <br><br>

                        When at the Insomnia events, we were invited to future events alongside having blog posts about
                        our game as being highlights of the events from <a

                        We also took part in the Patch Magazine competition where we were one of the runner ups for the
