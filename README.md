## About the Site
This portfolio site serves as a central hub for my development work, with a focus on:
- Games Development (Unity, C#, gameplay Systems)
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Interactive design and technical problem-solving

The site is designed as an interactive extension to a resume, providing a story behind the creation of projects and decisio making, applying my game development foundation into creating an interactive and intuitive system.

### Project Goals
- Present projects in a clear format
- Bridge my games background with web development
- Act in itsef a portfolio piece

### Featured Projects
The homepage displays a curated selection of up to **12 projects**.

> ⚠ <strong>Note:</strong> At time of writing, **9 projects** are currently featured, with additional projects as development continues toward the end of the year. <!-- REMOVE WHEN AT 12 GAMES! -->

These projects represent a mix of:
- Commercial and indie game development
- Game jam and academic work
- Web and interactive projects
- Tools, Prototypes, and technical experiments

The selection is intentionally limited to keep the homepage focused, readable, and visually consistent.

#### Why 12 Projects?

The homepage is built around a responsive grid system that adapts across screen sizes:
- 4 columns on large displays
- 3 columns on tablets
- 2 columns on small screens
- 1 column on mobile

A limit of 12 projects was chosen because it allows the grid to remain visually consistent at every breakpoint:
- 3 rows of 4 projects
- 4 rows of 3 projects
- 6 rows of 2 projects
- 12 rows of 1 project

This avoids uneven rows or incomplete columns wgeb resizing the page, ensuring the layout feels intentional and balanced across all devices.

> ⚠ <strong>Note:</strong> While fewer projects may be shown during active development, the layout is designed to scale cleanly up to the 12-project limit. <!-- REMOVE WHEN AT 12 GAMES! -->
